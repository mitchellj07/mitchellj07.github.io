<h1> Why is Exercise Important?</h1>
<h4> This is a common question that many people ask about fitness. <br> "Why should I exercise?" <br>
    "It's just a waste of time" <br> Here is a list of eight ways that exercising regularly can better anyone's life.
</h4> <br>

<ol>
    <li class="oli">It can help with relaxation and sleep quality</li>
    <p> When people exercise and feel tired afterwards, they enjoy their relaxation more and can often fall asleep more
        easily.</p> <br>

    <br><br>
    <li class ="oli">Exercise can help with brain health and memory</li>
    <p>Studies show that exercises both give you a mental break and increase bloodflow to your brain. <br> This in turn
        improves cognitive function and memory skills.</p> <br>

    <li class="oli">Exercise can help skin health</li>
    <p> Recent studies show that moderate excercise can actually improve skin health. <br> It has even recently been shown
    that regular excercise can slow skin aging and wrinkles.</p>
    <li class="oli">Exercise can reduce risk of chronic disease</li>
    <p>Exercise has been shown to reduce the risk of:</p>
    <ul>
        <li class="uli">Type 2 diabeties</li>
        <li class="uli">Heart disease</li>
        <li class="uli">Cancer</li>
        <li class="uli">High cholesterol</li>
        <li class="uli">Hypertension</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <li class="oli">Exercise can increase your energy levels</li>
    <p> Contrary to popular belief, exercise can actually improve your energy levels! <br> This is because a better
    cardiovascular system and better lung health allow your body to use less energy while performing everyday tasks.</p><br>
    <li class="oli">Exercise is good for your bones and muscles</li>
    <p>Exercise breaks down your muscles and thickens your bones. <br> This causes muscles to come back stronger. <br>
    Thicker, stronger muscles and bones will last better with age. General streangth is also just helpful to have through life. <br></p>
    <li class="oli">Exercise can help with weight management</li>
    <p>No matter your weight goals, a healthy diet paired with the appropriate exercise can help you reach them! <br>
        If you want to <em>lose weight</em>, pair a calorie deficit with cardio exercises. <br> If you want to <em>gain weight</em>,
    the best way to do so is by pairing weight training with a calorie surplus.</p>
    <li class="oli">Exercise makes you feel happier</li>
    <p>There are few better feelings as a human than feeling the accomplishment after compling a hard workout. <br> On top
    of that, being in better shape will make life easier, in turn making it easier to be happy. <br> Studies have shown that
    regular exercise increases dopamine levels in the brain and helps to cure depression, slowly but surely.</p> <br>
