<h2> Stretching</h2>
<p> Almost everyone knows what stretching is, but many people may not know that it is actually a type of exercise! <br>
    This is because stretching is the act of putting muscles in a position of tension to loosten them and be able to
    move
    them more freely. <br> Stretching is a very important part of physical fitness that many people skip out on,
    resulting
    in injuries like muscle strains or tears. <br></p>
